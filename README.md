# prashaant-netgen
Generates a network with an outer and an inner network, with each network having a choice of topology.

The ipynb notebook can be run to work with the verifier. The verifier generates a visual graph of the nodes, which can be checked for isomorphism, to prove that the generated output is the correct representation of the network
